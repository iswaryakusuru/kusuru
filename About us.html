<p><h2>Company Profile is an initiative by StartupTalky to publish verified information on different startups and organizations.</h2></p>
<p>There were days when we used to call different restaurants to place orders and again call up for corrections directions and reservations. Then came applications like Zomato, which reversed the whole scenario and made it extremely simple for consumers. Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah founded Zomato in 2008, which eased the process of food delivery and eating out, with the help of which we now can enjoy the best food served by the restaurants in our locality.
